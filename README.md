# Life Expectancy Analysis

This is another project which was done as a capstone for one of the courses in my Master's. 
We built a regression model on the data to be able to predict the life expectancy based on various different factors that we decided were relevant.
Also a hypothesis testing using ANOVA was done to delve deeper into how the different groups countries contrast from each other.

A short ppt to explain the project and show the results from it.

The data was pulled World Bank site and compiled to have the variables which coorelate the most with Life expectancy.

*We found some interesting findings when we did so. I suggest going through the PPT file it is a quick way to get an idea.*

The code itself is written in SAS and can be pretty verbose as it was being circulated between 3 people without any version control at the time.

For a more detailed report doc file is the best bet.
